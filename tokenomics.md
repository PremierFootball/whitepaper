## Token Utility

### 1. Buyback & Reward Participation
- Holders benefit from the **Buyback & Reward Pool**
- 20-30% of Net Revenue funds token buybacks from the open market
- Bought tokens are distributed to **active stakers** and partially **burned**
- Creates sustained buy pressure and reduces circulating supply over time

### 2. Future Governance Rights
- Token holders will gain progressive governance rights as the project matures
- Governance is activated based on project milestones, not arbitrary timelines
- Initial governance: community advisory votes (non-binding)
- Full strategic governance: activated after facility is operational and revenue is generated
- **No control** over operational sports decisions at any stage

### 3. Staking & Rewards
- Stake tokens to earn rewards from the Community Rewards pool
- Stakers receive priority in Buyback & Reward distributions
- Staking available from Day 1 of TGE

### 4. Holder Benefits
- Exclusive content access (training sessions, behind the scenes)
- Sports city visits and match tickets
- NFT commemoratives for milestone events
- Early access to future products or rounds

### 5. Transferability
- Trade on secondary markets
- DEX liquidity pool (TOKEN / USDT)
- Potential CEX listings in the future

---

## Liquidity Strategy

### Initial Liquidity

- **USD 600,000** allocated for initial DEX pool (protocol-owned liquidity)
- Liquidity **locked** to prevent rug pulls
- Deployed at TGE on Solana DEX (Raydium, Orca, or Jupiter)

### Ongoing Liquidity

- **Buybacks** from the Buyback & Reward Pool create sustained demand
- **Staking Programs** incentivize long-term holding, reducing circulating supply
- Gradual liquidity expansion as trading volume grows
- Market-driven price discovery

> **No guarantees** on liquidity, trading volume, or minimum price

---

## Buyback & Reward Pool

### How It Works

1. **20-30% of Net Revenue** is allocated to the Buyback & Reward Pool each period
2. The Pool **buys tokens from the open market** (DEX), creating buy pressure
3. A portion of bought tokens is **distributed to active stakers** as rewards
4. A portion is **burned**, permanently reducing supply

### Net Revenue Definition

> **Net Revenue** = Gross revenue from all sources (player transfers, training rights, sell-on clauses, TV rights, and competition bonuses) minus direct operational costs (staff salaries, facility maintenance, competition fees, player development costs, and regulatory compliance).
>
> **Excluded:** Capital expenditures funded from the initial raise are not deducted.

### Pool Rules

- **Minimum threshold:** Pool does not activate if Net Revenue < USD 100,000 in the period
- **Negative periods:** No debt accumulation. The Pool simply does not operate
- **Audit:** Annual independent review, results published on-chain
- **Percentage decision:** Set by the founding team (Phase 1-3), with community advisory input. Full community governance over the percentage is activated at a later milestone.

## Milestone Token Burns

At each major project milestone, tokens from the Ecosystem reserve are permanently burned:

| Milestone | Burn Amount |
|-----------|------------|
| Sports city construction complete | 1,000,000 tokens |
| First professional player signed | 500,000 tokens |
| First competitive match | 500,000 tokens |
| First player transfer | 2,000,000 tokens |
| **Total potential burn** | **4,000,000 tokens** (33% of Ecosystem) |

Burns reduce total supply, rewarding all holders with increased scarcity.

## Economic Model

### Revenue Sources

1. **Player Transfers** - Primary revenue driver
2. **Training Rights** - FIFA solidarity and compensation mechanisms
3. **Sell-on Clauses** - Future transfer participation
4. **TV Rights & Competition Revenue** - AUF and CONMEBOL distributions
