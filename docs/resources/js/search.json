Si todos los founders venden al mismo tiempo, el precio baja. Hay que coordinar.","El primer año es el más duro. Salario modesto, cero tokens, mucho trabajo. Es el año donde se necesita más fe y compromiso.","El salario se puede revisar. Si el proyecto genera revenue antes de lo esperado, los salarios pueden subir.
