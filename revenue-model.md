# Revenue Model

## Income Sources

### 1. Player Transfers

- Sale of developed players to international clubs (South America, Europe, MLS, Middle East)
- Transfer fees negotiated based on player performance and potential
- Historical precedent: Uruguay is the world's leading exporter of elite talent per capita

**Market Benchmarks:**
- **Elite Level (Peñarol/Nacional):** USD 5M - 15M+ per top prospect
- **Mid-Tier (Defensor/Danubio):** USD 1M - 5M per top prospect
- **Emerging Clubs:** USD 300k - 1.5M per initial transfer (often plus sell-on)

**Revenue Potential:** High upside, variable timing

---

### 2. Training Rights & FIFA Mechanisms

**FIFA Solidarity Mechanism**

- 5% of transfer fees distributed to training clubs
- Applies to all future transfers of players trained at our facility
- Passive income stream from player career progression

**Training Compensation**

- Compensation for player development costs
- Applies when players move between clubs

**Revenue Potential:** Recurring, long-tail income

---

### 3. Sell-on Clauses

**Future Transfer Participation**

- Negotiate percentage of future transfer fees
- Typical range: 10-30% of future sales
- Compounds value as players progress in their careers

**Example:**
- Player sold for USD 500k with 20% sell-on clause
- Player later sold for USD 5M
- Project receives USD 1M (20% of USD 5M)

**Revenue Potential:** High upside, long-term

---

### 4. TV Rights & Competition Revenue

**League Distribution (AUF)**
- **Divisional A:** ~USD 2,000,000 annually (New 2026-2029 cycle projections)
- **Divisional B:** ~USD 800,000 annually
- Guaranteed recurring revenue upon reaching professional categories

**CONMEBOL Bonuses**
- Participation in Copa Sudamericana: USD 250k - 500k+ per stage
- Participation in Copa Libertadores: USD 1M - 3M+ for group stage
- Merit-based bonuses for matches won

**Revenue Potential:** Steady, tiered growth

## Buyback & Reward Pool

### How Revenue Flows to Token Holders

Instead of direct revenue distributions, the project operates a **Buyback & Reward Pool** that creates sustained demand for the token while rewarding active participants.

### Mechanism

1. **20-30% of Net Revenue** is allocated to the Buyback & Reward Pool each period
2. The Pool **buys tokens from the open market** (DEX), creating consistent buy pressure
3. A portion of bought tokens is **distributed to active stakers** as rewards
4. A portion is **permanently burned**, reducing total supply

### Why This Model

- **For token price:** Buybacks create real, sustained demand on the open market
- **For stakers:** Active participants earn additional tokens as rewards
- **For all holders:** Burns reduce supply, increasing scarcity over time
- **Transparency:** All buybacks and burns are executed and verifiable on-chain

### Net Revenue Definition

> **Net Revenue** = Gross revenue from all sources (player transfers, training rights, sell-on clauses, TV rights, and competition bonuses) minus direct operational costs (staff salaries, facility maintenance, competition fees, player development costs, and regulatory compliance).
>
> **Excluded:** Capital expenditures funded from the initial raise are not deducted.

### Pool Rules

- **Minimum threshold:** Pool does not activate if Net Revenue < USD 100,000 in the period
- **Negative periods:** No debt accumulation. The Pool simply does not operate that period.
- **Audit:** Annual independent review, results published on-chain
- **Percentage decision:** Set by the founding team during early phases, with community advisory input. Full community governance over the percentage is activated at a later milestone.
