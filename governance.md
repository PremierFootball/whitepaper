# Governance (DAO)

## Overview

The Premier Football project implements a **hybrid governance model** that balances community participation with operational expertise.

Token holders participate in strategic decisions through a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**, while day-to-day sports operations remain under professional management.

---

## DAO Decision Authority

### What the DAO Controls 

#### 1. Treasury Allocation
- Vote on strategic investments and major capital expenditures
- Vote on budget allocations beyond operational baseline

#### 2. Project Expansion
- Vote on new facility constructions
- Vote on geographic expansion
- Vote on new business lines

#### 3. Revenue Distribution
- Set annual distribution percentage (within 20-30% range)
- Vote on special distributions
- Vote on buyback strategies

#### 4. Strategic Partnerships
- Vote on major partnership agreements
- Vote on equity or token swaps
- Vote on strategic collaborations

---

### What the DAO Does NOT Control ❌

#### Operational Sports Decisions

The DAO **does not** make decisions about:

- Player recruitment and selection
- Coaching staff appointments
- Training methodologies
- Match strategies and tactics

> **Rationale:** Sports decisions require professional expertise and cannot be effectively managed by committee vote. The founding team retains operational autonomy to ensure competitive performance.

## Governance Mechanism

### Voting Power

- **1 token = 1 vote**
- Voting power proportional to token holdings
- No maximum voting cap (whales can have significant influence)

### Proposal Process

| Proposal Type | Quorum | Approval Threshold | Voting Period |
|--------------|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Treasury Allocation** | 10% | 66% | 7 days |
| **Expansion Projects** | 15% | 66% | 7 days |
| **Distribution %** | 10% | 51% | 5 days |
| **Partnerships** | 10% | 51% | 5 days |

## Governance Evolution

### Phase 1: Founding Team Control (Year 1-2)

- **Focus:** Construction and initial setup
- **Governance:** Founding team has veto power
- **Rationale:** Critical execution phase requires decisive leadership

### Phase 2: Hybrid Governance (Year 2-4)

- **Focus:** Operations and early revenue
- **Governance:** DAO votes on major decisions, team executes
- **Rationale:** Balance community input with operational efficiency

### Phase 3: Full DAO (Year 4+)

- **Focus:** Mature operations and expansion
- **Governance:** DAO has full control over strategic decisions
- **Rationale:** Project is stable and community-driven

### Veto Rights (Phase 1-2)

- Founding team can veto proposals that:
  - Threaten project viability
  - Violate legal/regulatory requirements
  - Compromise sports operations

### Proposal Bonds

!!!tip Governance Philosophy
**"Decentralize strategy, centralize execution."**

The DAO controls the "what" and "why" (strategic direction), while the professional team controls the "how" (operational execution). This ensures both community alignment and professional excellence.
