# Governance & Transparency

## Overview

The Premier Football project operates under a **team-managed model with progressive decentralization**. The founding team has full operational and strategic authority during the early phases, with governance rights being activated based on real project milestones.

All financial activity is managed through a **multisig wallet** and reported transparently on-chain.

> Governance rights will be activated progressively as the project matures. During Phase 1-3, the founding team operates with full decision-making authority over sports and business operations. Community governance mechanisms will be introduced based on project milestones, not arbitrary timelines.

---

## Current Operating Model (Phase 1-3)

### Team-Managed Operations

The founding team makes all operational, strategic, and financial decisions:

- Player recruitment and development
- Coaching staff appointments and training methodologies
- Club partnerships and commercial agreements
- Budget allocation and financial planning
- Infrastructure development and maintenance

### Transparency Mechanisms

While the team operates with full authority, all activity is transparent:

- **Multisig wallet** for all fund movements
- **On-chain tracking** of all financial transactions
- **Public dashboard** with project metrics and financials
- **Monthly community calls** (AMAs)
- **Quarterly financial reports** published on-chain

---

## Multisig Treasury

### Structure: 3-of-5

| Signer | Role |
|--------|------|
| Founder 1 | CEO / Project Lead |
| Founder 2 | CTO / Tech Lead |
| Founder 3 | COO / Operations |
| Legal Advisor | External legal representative |
| Investor Representative | Elected from Seed round top holders (activated post-Seed) |

### Rules

- **Threshold:** 3 of 5 signatures required for execution
- **Key rotation:** Every 12 months
- **Recovery:** 4 of 5 to replace a compromised or unavailable signer
- **Public dashboard:** All movements published on-chain in real-time
- **5th signer activation:** Investor representative joins after Seed round closes

---

## Progressive Decentralization Roadmap

Governance rights are activated based on real milestones, not timelines. This ensures governance is introduced when the project has the operational maturity to support it.

### Milestone-Based Governance Activation

| Milestone | Governance Feature Activated |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Facility operational** | Community advisory votes (non-binding) on strategic direction |
| **First player transfer** | Binding community votes on Buyback & Reward Pool percentage (20-30%) |
| **Sustained positive Net Revenue** | Binding votes on treasury allocation for expansion and new initiatives |
| **>50% of team tokens vested** | Full strategic governance: community votes on major partnerships, expansion, and treasury strategy |

### What the Community Will Eventually Control

- Buyback & Reward Pool percentage (within 20-30% range)
- Treasury allocation for expansion projects
- Major partnership agreements
- Strategic direction of the project

### What the Community Will Never Control

- Player recruitment and selection
- Coaching staff appointments
- Training methodologies
- Match strategies and tactics
- Day-to-day operational decisions

> **Rationale:** Sports decisions require professional expertise and cannot be effectively managed by committee vote. The founding team retains permanent operational autonomy to ensure competitive performance.

## KYC & Compliance

### Token Sale Compliance

| Round | KYC Requirement | Method |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| **Seed** | Full KYC + accredited investor verification | Third-party provider (Sumsub / Synaps) |
| **Private** | Full KYC | Third-party provider (Sumsub / Synaps) |
| **Public / Launchpad** | Launchpad KYC (if applicable) + geo-blocking | Launchpad-managed |

### Restricted Jurisdictions

Token sale is restricted in: United States, China, North Korea, Iran, Cuba, and all OFAC/EU sanctioned jurisdictions.

### Ongoing Compliance

- AML screening for Seed and Private round participants

!!!tip Governance Philosophy
**"Transparency now, decentralization earned."**

We believe governance should be introduced when a project has proven it can operate, not promised at launch and never delivered. Our approach is to operate transparently from day one and progressively hand over strategic control as the project matures.
